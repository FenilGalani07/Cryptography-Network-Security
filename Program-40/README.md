## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-40
   ```

## Usage

To use the array reverser program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Reverse_Array.py
```

You will be prompted to enter elements separated by spaces. The program will then display the reversed array.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a list of integers.
2. It splits the input string into individual elements and converts them to integers.
3. It reverses the array using slicing.
4. Finally, it prints the reversed array.

## Example

```
Enter elements separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5
Reversed array: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

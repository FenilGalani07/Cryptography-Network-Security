## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-12
   ```

## Usage

To use the matrix sum calculator, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python 2 by 2 Matrix_Addition.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns, followed by the elements of the two matrices. The program will then display the sum of the two matrices.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the dimensions of the matrices.
2. It collects the elements of both matrices from the user.
3. It calculates the sum of the two matrices element-wise.
4. Finally, it prints the resulting matrix.

## Example

```
Enter the number of rows: 2
Enter the number of columns: 2
Matrix 1:
Row 1: 1 2
Row 2: 3 4
Matrix 2:
Row 1: 5 6
Row 2: 7 8
Sum of the two matrices:
6 8
10 12

```

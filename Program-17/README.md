### Find Indices of Array Elements that Sum to a Given Value

## Description

This project implements a Python program that finds the indices of elements in an array that sum up to a specified value. The user can input an array and a target sum, and the program will display the indices of the elements that meet the criteria.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-17
   ```

## Usage

To use the indices finder, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Array.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the elements of the array and the target sum. The program will then display the indices of the elements that sum to the specified value.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the elements of the array and the target sum.
2. It iterates through the array to find pairs of indices whose corresponding values sum to the target.
3. Finally, it prints the indices of the elements that meet the criteria.

## Example

```
Enter the elements of the array separated by spaces: 2 2 3
Enter the target sum: 5
Indices of elements that sum to 5: [0, 1]
```

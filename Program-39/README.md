## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-39
   ```

## Usage

To use the array sorter program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Sorting_Element.py
```

You will be prompted to enter elements separated by spaces. The program will then display the sorted array.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a list of integers.
2. It splits the input string into individual elements and converts them to integers.
3. It sorts the array using the built-in `sorted` function.
4. Finally, it prints the sorted array.

## Example

```
Enter elements separated by spaces: 5 2 9 1 5 6
Sorted array: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

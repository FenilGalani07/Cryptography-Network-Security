## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-18
   ```

## Usage

To use the Roman to integer converter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Roman_To_Integer_Number.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a Roman numeral. The program will then display the integer value of the input.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a Roman numeral.
2. It uses a dictionary to map Roman characters to their integer values.
3. It iterates through the Roman numeral in reverse order, adding or subtracting values based on the rules of Roman numeral notation.
4. Finally, it prints the integer equivalent of the Roman numeral.

## Example

```
Enter a Roman numeral: XIV
The integer value of 'XIV' is: 14
```

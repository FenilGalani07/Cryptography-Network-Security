## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-29
   ```

## Usage

To use the diamond pattern printer, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Triangular_Star_Pattern.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of rows for the diamond pattern. The program will then display the pattern.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows for the upper part of the diamond.
2. It prints the upper part of the diamond by iterating through the rows and printing leading spaces followed by stars.
3. It then prints the lower part of the diamond in a similar manner.
4. Finally, it prints the complete diamond pattern.

## Example

```
Enter the number of rows for the diamond pattern: 5

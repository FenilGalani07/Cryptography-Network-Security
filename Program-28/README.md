## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-28
   ```

## Usage

To use the pyramid pattern printer, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Star_Pattern.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of rows for the pyramid pattern. The program will then display the pattern.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows.
2. It iterates through the range of rows, printing leading spaces followed by the appropriate number of stars to form the pyramid.
3. Finally, it prints the pyramid pattern.

## Example

```
Enter the number of rows for the pyramid pattern: 4
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

### Check if Two Strings are Isomorphic

## Description

This project implements a Python program that checks whether two given strings are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in one string can be replaced to get the second string.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-33
   ```

## Usage

To use the isomorphic strings checker, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Isomorphic_Strings.py
```

You will be prompted to enter two strings. The program will then check if the strings are isomorphic and display the result.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter two strings.
2. It checks if the lengths of the strings are equal. If not, they cannot be isomorphic.
3. It uses a dictionary to map characters from the first string to the second string and a set to track already mapped characters.
4. It iterates through the characters of both strings, updating the mapping and checking for inconsistencies.
5. Finally, it prints whether the strings are isomorphic.

## Example

```
Enter the first string: egg
Enter the second string: add
The strings 'egg' and 'add' are isomorphic.
```

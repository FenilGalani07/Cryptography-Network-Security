## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Project-8
   ```

## Usage

To use the number to words converter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python number_to_words.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a number between 0 and 999. The program will then display the number in words.

## How It Works

1. The program defines a function to convert numbers to words.
2. It uses a dictionary to map numbers to their corresponding words.
3. The function handles numbers less than 100, less than 1000, and negative numbers.
4. Finally, it prints the word representation of the input number.

## Example

```
Enter a number (0-999): 25
25 in words is: twenty five
```

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Project-10
   ```

## Usage

To use the number reversal program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Reverse_a_Number_Using_any_Loop.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a positive integer. The program will then display the reversed number.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
2. It uses a loop to extract each digit from the number and constructs the reversed number.
3. Finally, it prints the reversed number.

## Example

```
Enter a positive integer: 12345
The reversed number is: 54321
```

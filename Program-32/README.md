## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-32
   ```

## Usage

To use the remove duplicates program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Remove_Duplication.py
```

You will be prompted to enter elements separated by spaces. The program will then display the unique elements.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a list of elements.
2. It uses a set to track seen elements and a list to store unique elements.
3. It iterates through the input list, adding elements to the unique list only if they haven't been seen before.
4. Finally, it prints the unique elements.

## Example

```
Enter elements separated by spaces: apple banana orange apple grape banana
Unique elements: apple banana orange grape
```

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-19
   ```

## Usage

To use the longest common prefix finder, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Prefix.py
```

You will be prompted to enter strings separated by commas. The program will then display the longest common prefix.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a list of strings.
2. It initializes the prefix with the first string.
3. It iterates through the remaining strings, reducing the prefix until it matches the start of each string.
4. Finally, it prints the longest common prefix found.

## Example

```
Enter strings separated by commas: Flower, Flow, Flight
The longest common prefix is: 'Fl'
```

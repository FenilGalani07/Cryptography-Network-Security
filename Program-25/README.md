## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-25
   ```

## Usage

To use the pattern printer, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Pattern-1.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of rows for the pattern. The program will then display the pattern.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows.
2. It iterates through the range of rows in reverse order, printing numbers from 1 to the current row number.
3. Finally, it prints the pattern.

## Example

```
Enter the number of rows for the pattern: 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
```

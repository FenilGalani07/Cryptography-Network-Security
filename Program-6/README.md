## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-6
   ```

## Usage

To use the prime number finder, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python prime_range.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the start and end of the range. The program will then display all prime numbers within that range.

## How It Works

1. The program defines a function to check if a number is prime.
2. It iterates through the specified range and collects all prime numbers.
3. Finally, it prints the list of prime numbers found in the range.

## Example

```
Enter the start of the range: 10
Enter the end of the range: 50
Prime numbers between 10 and 50: [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
```

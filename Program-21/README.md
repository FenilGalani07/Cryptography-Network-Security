## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-21
   ```

## Usage

To use the count and say program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python count_and_say.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a number. The program will then display the count and description of the digits in the input number.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. It iterates through the digits of the number, counting consecutive occurrences of each digit.
3. It constructs a description string that states how many of each digit there are.
4. Finally, it prints the result.

## Example

```
Enter a number: 332251
Count and say result: two 3's, two 2's, one 5's, one 1's
```

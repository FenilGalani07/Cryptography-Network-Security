## Description

This project implements a Python program that multiplies two matrices. The user can input the dimensions and elements of the matrices, and the program will display the resulting matrix after multiplication.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-13
   ```

## Usage

To use the matrix multiplication calculator, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Multiplication_of_two_Matrix.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the dimensions and elements of the two matrices. The program will then display the result of the multiplication.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the dimensions of the matrices.
2. It collects the elements of both matrices from the user.
3. It checks if the multiplication is possible based on the dimensions.
4. It calculates the product of the two matrices.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting matrix.

## Example

```
Enter the number of rows for the first matrix: 2
Enter the number of columns for the first matrix: 3
Matrix 1:
Row 1: 1 2 3
Row 2: 4 5 6
Enter the number of rows for the second matrix: 3
Enter the number of columns for the second matrix: 2
Matrix 2:
Row 1: 7 8
Row 2: 9 10
Row 3: 11 12
Result of the multiplication:
58 64
139 154

```

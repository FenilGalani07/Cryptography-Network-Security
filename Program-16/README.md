### Check if a String is in Camel Case

## Description

This project implements a Python program that checks whether a given string is in **Camel Case** format. Camel Case is a style of writing where the first letter of each word is capitalized except for the first word, which starts with a lowercase letter.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-16
   ```

## Usage

To use the Camel Case checker, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Camel_Case_or_Not.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a string. The program will then check if the string is in Camel Case format.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a string.
2. It checks if the first character is lowercase.
3. It iterates through the string to ensure that uppercase letters are not at the beginning and that there are no underscores.
4. Finally, it prints whether the string is in Camel Case format.

## Example

```
Enter a string: camelCaseExample
The string 'camelCaseExample' is in Camel Case.
```

```
Enter a string: CamelCaseExample
The string 'CamelCaseExample' is not in Camel Case.
```

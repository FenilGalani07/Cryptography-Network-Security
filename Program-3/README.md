### Armstrong Number Check

## Description

This project implements a Python program to check whether a given non-negative integer is an **Armstrong number**. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-3
   ```

## Usage

To use the Armstrong number checker, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python armstrong.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a number. The program will then check and display whether the given number is an Armstrong number.

## How It Works

1. The program converts the input number to a string to easily iterate over its digits.
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
3. Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number.

## Example

```
Enter a number: 153
153 is an Armstrong number.
```

```
Enter a number: 123
123 is not an Armstrong number.
```

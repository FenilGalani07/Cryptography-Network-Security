### Factorial Calculation

## Description

This project implements a Python program to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer using a dynamic programming approach. The program efficiently computes the factorial by storing previously calculated values, reducing the time complexity.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-2
   ```

## Usage

To use the factorial calculator, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python factorial.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a non-negative integer. The program will then calculate and display the factorial of the given number.

## How It Works

1. The program initializes a list `dp` to store factorial values.
2. It iteratively calculates the factorial for each number from 2 to `n` and stores the result in the list.
3. Finally, it returns the factorial of the input number.

## Example

```
Enter a non-negative integer: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

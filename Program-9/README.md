## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Project-9
   ```

## Usage

To use the multiplication table generator, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python multiplication_table.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a number. The program will then display the multiplication table for that number.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. It uses a loop to calculate and print the multiplication table from 1 to 10.
3. The results are displayed in a formatted manner.

## Example

```
Enter a number to print its multiplication table: 5
Multiplication Table of 5:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

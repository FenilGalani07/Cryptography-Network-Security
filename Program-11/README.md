## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-11
   ```

## Usage

To use the digit counter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Number_of_Digits_of_an_Integer.py
```

You will be prompted to enter an integer. The program will then display the number of digits in that integer.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. It checks if the number is negative and converts it to positive if necessary.
3. It uses a loop to count the digits by continuously dividing the number by 10.
4. Finally, it prints the count of digits.

## Example

```
Enter an integer: 12345
The number of digits in 12345 is: 5
```

```
Enter an integer: -6789
The number of digits in -6789 is: 4
```

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-22
   ```

## Usage

To use the square hollow pattern drawer, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Square_Hollow_Pattern.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the size of the square. The program will then display the hollow square pattern.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the square.
2. It checks if the size is valid (greater than or equal to 2).
3. It iterates through the rows and columns to print '*' for the borders and spaces for the hollow part.
4. Finally, it prints the hollow square pattern.

## Example

```
Enter the size of the square: 5
* * * * *
*       *
*       *
*       *
* * * * *
```

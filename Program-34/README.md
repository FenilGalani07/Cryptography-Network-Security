## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-34
   ```

## Usage

To use the character replacement program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Character_Replace.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the original string, the index of the character to replace, and the new character. The program will then display the resulting string.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the original string.
2. It asks for the index of the character to replace and the new character.
3. It checks if the index is valid (within the range of the string).
4. It replaces the character at the specified index and constructs the new string.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

## Example

```
Enter the original string: hello
Enter the index of the character to replace: 1
Enter the new character: a
Resulting string: hallo
```

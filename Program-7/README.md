## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-7
   ```

## Usage

To use the factors finder, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python factors.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a positive integer. The program will then display all factors of the given number.

## How It Works

1. The program defines a function to find factors of the input number.
2. It iterates from 1 to the number itself, checking for divisibility.
3. If a number divides the input number without a remainder, it is added to the list of factors.
4. Finally, it prints the list of factors found.

## Example

```
Enter a positive integer: 6
Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
```

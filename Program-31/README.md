### Print Spiral Matrix

## Description

This project implements a Python program that generates a spiral matrix of size n x n, starting from the top left and moving left to right, row-wise. The user can specify the size of the matrix, and the program will display the resulting spiral matrix.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-31
   ```

## Usage

To use the spiral matrix generator, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Spiral_Matrix.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the size of the spiral matrix. The program will then display the generated spiral matrix.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the matrix (n).
2. It initializes an n x n matrix filled with zeros.
3. It uses four pointers (left, right, top, bottom) to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix.
4. It fills the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting the pointers accordingly.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting spiral matrix.

## Example

```
Enter the size of the spiral matrix (n x n): 5
Spiral Matrix:
1 2 3 4 5
16 17 18 19 6
15 24 25 20 7
14 23 22 21 8
13 12 11 10 9
```

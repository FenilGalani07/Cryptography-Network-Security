### Find the GCD of Two Numbers

## Description

This project implements a Python program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two inputted numbers. The user can input two integers, and the program will display their GCD.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Cryptography-Network-Security
   ```

## Usage

To use the GCD calculator program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python GDG.py
```

You will be prompted to enter two numbers. The program will then display the GCD of the two numbers.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter two integers.
2. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD:
   - While the second number is not zero, it replaces the first number with the second number and the second number with the remainder of the first number divided by the second number.
3. Finally, it prints the GCD of the two numbers.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 48
Enter the second number: 18
The GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6
```

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-14
   ```

## Usage

To use the vowel removal program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Remove_Vowels_from_String.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a string. The program will then display the string after removing all vowels.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a string.
2. It defines a string of vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
3. It uses a list comprehension to filter out the vowels from the input string.
4. Finally, it prints the modified string without vowels.

## Example

```
Enter a string: Hello World
String after removing vowels: Hll Wrld
```

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-15
   ```

## Usage

To use the duplicate removal program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Remove_Duplication_From_String.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a string. The program will then display the string after removing all duplicate characters.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a string.
2. It uses a set to track seen characters and a list to build the result.
3. It iterates through the input string, adding characters to the result only if they haven't been seen before.
4. Finally, it prints the modified string without duplicates.

## Example

```
Enter a string: Hello World
String after removing duplicates: Helo Wrd
```

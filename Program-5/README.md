## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-5
   ```

## Usage

To use the prime number checker, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python prime.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a number. The program will then check and display whether the given number is a prime number.

## How It Works

1. The program checks if the input number is less than or equal to 1; if so, it returns false.
2. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking for factors.
3. If any factor is found, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

## Example

```
Enter a number: 17
17 is a prime number.
```

```
Enter a number: 18
18 is not a prime number.
```

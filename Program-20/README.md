## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-20
   ```

## Usage

To use the permutation finder, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Permutations.py
```

You will be prompted to enter numbers separated by commas. The program will then display all permutations of the input numbers.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a list of numbers.
2. It uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all possible permutations of the list.
3. Finally, it prints each permutation.

## Example

```
Enter numbers separated by commas: 1, 2, 3
All permutations:
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 3, 2)
(2, 1, 3)
(2, 3, 1)
(3, 1, 2)
(3, 2, 1)
```

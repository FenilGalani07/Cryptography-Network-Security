## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Cryptography-Network-Security
   ```

## Usage

To use the string swapping program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Swap_Two_String.py
```

You will be prompted to enter two strings. The program will then display the strings before and after swapping.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter two strings.
2. It prints the original strings.
3. It swaps the strings using tuple unpacking.
4. Finally, it prints the swapped strings.

## Example

```
Enter the first string: Hello
Enter the second string: World
Before swapping:
String 1: Hello
String 2: World
After swapping:
String 1: World
String 2: Hello
```

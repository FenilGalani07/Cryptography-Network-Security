## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Cryptography-Network-Security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Program-22
   ```

## Usage

To use the matrix rotation program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Rotate_matrix.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a 3x3 matrix row by row. The program will then display the rotated matrix.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a 3x3 matrix.
2. It creates a new matrix to hold the rotated values.
3. It iterates through the original matrix and assigns values to the new matrix in a rotated manner.
4. Finally, it prints the rotated matrix.

## Example

```
Enter a 3x3 matrix (row by row, space-separated):
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Rotated Matrix:
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```
